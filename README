# Capacitor Templates for [Remix.run](https://remix.run/)

This repository holds production ready Capacitor templates for building native mobile applications using Remix. Using Capacitor, you can quickly build out a native mobile application for iOS and Android using web technology, such as Remix.

## Getting Started

Be sure to follow our [getting started guide](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started/environment-setup) for Capacitor to setup your environment correctly. Once your environment is set up for mobile development, you can use [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to clone one of these Capacitor templates and start building your native app with Remi!

When developing, you can use vite just as you would for a standard web application. For these templates, you can run `npm start` to boot up the remix dev server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR). Once you are ready to test your app on mobile, you can use one of the following commands to build and run your native app on your mobile device.

#### iOS

```bash
npm run build
npx cap run ios
```

#### Android

```bash
npm run build
npx cap run android
```

_note: The Capacitor + Remix dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`. This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. The `pnpn-lock.yaml` file can be safely be removed once you clone a template if you would like to use another package manager like `npm` or `yarn`._

### Deploying to App Stores

Once you are ready to deploy your app, you can follow our guides building your native application for the [Apple App Store](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/ios/deploying-to-app-store) or the [Google Play Store](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/android/deploying-to-google-play).

## Template List

To download one of these templates, you use the following the command:

```bash
npx degit ionic-team/capacitor-remix-templates/<template> my-project
cd my-project
npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

The following templates are available for both JavaScript and TypeScript:
- [architect](https://github.com/architect/architect)
- [cloudflare-pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
- [cloudflare-workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)
- [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
- [fly](https://fly.io/)
- [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [remix-app-server](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/other-api/serve)
- [vercel](https://vercel.com/)

To use the TypeScript version of the template, add `-ts` to the end of the template

```bash
# Use "remix-app-server" with TypeScript support
npx degit ionic-team/capacitor-remix-templates/remix-app-server-ts my-project
cd my-project
npm install
```

## I don't see a template that matches my need?

You wish there was a template with your favorite library?

Feel free to make a pull request. Copy one of the template already available, tweak it, name it properly and make a PR. See [contributing](#contributing) below.

## Contributing

This project is managed with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io). You should [install it](https://pnpm.io/installation) first to test out your template or contribute to an existing one.

You can create your own template and prefix it with `ts-` or `js-` and giving it a name that describe the purpose.

To update all dependencies you can run:

`pnpm up -Lri`
